My name is Abhay, and I have a strong passion for solving coding challenges.  
I have solved over 500 questions on different platforms, including CodeChef, where I hold a Java Fundamentals certificate.  
I recently cleared the TCS NQT for the Digital role and successfully cleared the TCS interview for the Digital role.  
Apart from coding, I am a district-level cricket tournament winner and enjoy playing the sport.  
Digital Communication is my favorite subject, and I aim to continue expanding my knowledge in this field.
